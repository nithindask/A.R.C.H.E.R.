## Overview
A.R.C.H.E.R. is a precision-based human performance regulation system that scores individual effort, discipline, and integrity through a singular metric: **Arrows (↗)**. The system is mechanical, unforgiving, and strictly calibrated. No motivation. No rewards without cost. Only raw accountability.
